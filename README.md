Theoretical Physics, MPhys (Hons), graduated from the University of Edinburgh.
Currently a PhD student with [AGQ CDT](https://www.agq-cdt.org) & [TAPLab](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~dmichiel/) @ University of Edinburgh.
Interested in mathematical, computational and physics inspired techniques used to solve problems motivated by scientific theory.

Current areas of focus are computational mathematics, specifically applying machine learning methods to learn more about the interplay between geometry and topology (see my PyKnot repository for work on identifying knot invariants via ML).
