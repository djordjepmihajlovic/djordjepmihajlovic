Currently a final year, masters of physics student at the University of Edinburgh.
Interested in mathematical and computational techniques used to solve problems motivated by scientific theory.

Current areas of focus are computational condensed matter physics, specifically applying machine learning methods to learn more about physical systems (request access to my PyKnot repository for my masters project on identifying knot invariants via ML).
